# Popular GitHub Repository

The goal is to create a single page application that consumes GitHub’s API, and after providing
a repository name, displays the following information:

* Repository’s name and author
* Author’s profile picture
* Repository’s stars and forks
* Whether the repository is popular or not

# Installation 

Go to `src/scripts/config.js` , replace the access token with your own access token.

* `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

# Unit test 

* `npm test`
